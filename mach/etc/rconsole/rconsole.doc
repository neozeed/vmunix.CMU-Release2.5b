		     NOTES ON THE RCONSOLE FACILITY

The rconsole facility, which allows access to the console of a remote
machine via a (hardwired) tty line, consists of two programs.  The
first program, rconsoled, is a daemon program which should normally be
started up automatically at boot time.  The file /etc/rc.local should
include a line for each rconsoled daemon to be started.  A separate daemon
is required for each remote console tty line.  The rconsoled daemon performs
two tasks.  First, it logs (in a file on the local machine) all output that
appears on the remote console.  Second, it supports a "chat" service,
allowing a user on any remote machine to "connect" his tty to the console
port of the remote machine.

The second program in the rconsole facility is the rconsole utility program.
This is the program that is run by the user when he wishes to connect to a
remote console.  Once connected, all input typed by the user will be sent to
the remote machine through the corresponding rconsoled daemon.  All output
to the remote console will continue to be logged by the rconsoled daemon,
but it will also now appear on the user's tty as well.  Thus, the user's tty
can effectively be regarded as the console terminal of the remote machine.

Use:
1) rconsoled [-a] name &
	where name is one of the remote machines listed in /etc/rconsoles.
	Any of the available aliases listed in /etc/rconsoles is acceptable.
	The -a flag causes the rconsoled daemon to request a password
	from the rconsole client before allowing access to the console
	tty.  If this flag is not specified, any user knowing the appropriate
	port number (which is listed in the /etc/services file on all CS
	vaxen) may run rconsole and have access to the remote console.  If
	-a is specified, rconsole will request a password, which should be
	the login password for the user listed as RCONSOLE_ID in the
	rconsole.h file (on the server's machine).
	The only way to terminate rconsoled is by killing it, or sending it
	a termination message using the -k option of rconsole (see below).

2) rconsole [-eC] [-l logfile] [-k] name
	where name is one of the remote machines listed in /etc/rconsoles.
	Any of the available aliases listed in /etc/rconsoles is acceptable.
	To terminate the program, type ^_ (CTRL-Underscore).  This escape
	character (^_) can be changed through use of the -e option.  No space
	should separate the -e option flag from the argument character.
	If a script of the console session is desired (in addition to the log
	produced by the rconsoled daemon) the -l option can be used.  All
	console output will be appended to the end of the file whose name is
	specified following the -l flag.  If logfile doesn't exist, it will be
	created.  Whether or not the -l option is used, a log of the current
	console session will be maintained by the rconsoled daemon, along with
	all of the other console activity preceding and following this
	session.
	The -k flag can be used to kill the rconsoled daemon associated with
	the specified remote console.  In this case, no chat session will
	take place, and none will be possible until the daemon is restarted.
	If the rconsoled daemon requests a password, one will prompted
	for and sent.  If rconsoled then says the password is valid, 
	normal operation will begin.  If not, then rconsole will quit.
	
Examples:
1) To start up the rconsoled daemon for the remote machine called wb4:
	rconsoled wb4 &

2) To start up that same daemon with authorization:
	rconsoled -f wb4 &

3) To connect to the console of wb4:
	rconsole wb4

4) To connect to wb4, and record a personal copy of the console session:
	rconsole -l mylogfile wb4

5) To terminate the rconsoled daemon for wb4:
	rconsole -k wb4


	     Files Used or Affected by the Rconsole Facility

/dev/ttyNN:
The local tty lines which are hardwired to the consoles of remote machines
should have their protection set so that they are r/w only by their owner
(root).  No one else should be permitted any access.  This will ensure that
only the rconsoled daemons started (owned) by root will be able to directly
access the remote consoles.

/etc/ttys:
The entries for the tty lines which are hardwired to the consoles of remote
machines should be disabled, by putting a zero as the first character of
those entries.  This will prevent the init process from trying to start up a
getty process on those tty lines.

/etc/rc.local:
Should include lines, similar to the example shown above, for starting up the
various rconsoled daemons.  One daemon should be started for each of the
remote machine consoles which are accessible via a hardwired tty line.

/etc/rconsoles:
This file contains the list of remote machines (and their aliases), and is
used for mapping machine names to local tty lines.  Each line of the file
usually corresponds to a different remote machine console, and has the
following format:
    <tty> <baud> <server_host> <port> <common_name> [alias1] [alias2] ...
The first five fields are required, and
at most 9 aliases are permitted.  If more aliases are needed, additional
lines, whose first five fields are identical, should be
used.  <tty> is the name of the local tty line, e.g. tty07, as specified in
the /dev directory.  <baud> is the baud rate code for the tty line, as
defined in <sgtty.h> (see TTY(4)).  <common_name> is the name most commonly
used in referring to the remote machine, and is the name which appears as a
component of some of the file names to be discussed below.  The aliases are
other names by which the remote machine is also known.  Either the common
name or any of the aliases can be used when specifying the remote machine to
rconsole or rconsoled.  Note that case is significant in the common name and
the aliases.  An example entry in /etc/rconsoles might look as follows:
	tty07	9	wb4	cmu-cs-wb4 WB4 CMU-CS-WB4 4
Note that the <baud> value of 9 means 1200 baud.
<server_host> is the name of the host on which the daemon for this
particular console runs.  <port> is the inet port number on this
host which is associated with this particular daemon.  This port number
should be a privileged one (<1024) so that unprivileged users may not
create fake rconsole daemons which would then wait for someone to run
rconsole and tell them the password.

/usr/adm/rconsole/<common_name>:
Log of "recent" console output for the remote machine <common_name>.  When a
log file grows beyond 250000 bytes long, rconsoled renames it to be
/usr/adm/rconsole/<common_name>.old, and creates a new log file, with the
same name as before, to hold subsequent console output.
