Apr 13, 1990
  Added new set of /usr/mach/man/man2 man pages. Most noticible change
was the rewriting of the memory_control and memory_object sections as
as separate section for each primitive.

  Added more sources, so that all the source files necessary to make
the CMU build environment are available. The following directories were added
	bin/awk, bin/sed, usr/bin/yacc, usr/bin/lex, usr/cs/bin/find
